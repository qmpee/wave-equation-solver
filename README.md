## What is the wave function ?
```
∂²ψ/∂t² = c² ∂²ψ/∂x²

In quantum mechanics, the wave function is a mathematical description of the state of a physical system. It provides a way to calculate the probability of finding a particular particle, such as an electron, in a specific location or with a certain energy.

The wave function is represented by a mathematical equation, usually denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). It is a complex-valued function that is defined over the position, momentum, or other variables that describe the state of the system.

The wave function is an important concept in quantum mechanics because it gives us a way to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a particular state. This is known as the Born rule, which states that the probability of finding a particle in a particular location is given by the absolute value of the wave function squared at that location.

For example, if you measure the position of an electron and find it to be at a particular point in space, the wave function gives you the probability of finding the electron at that point. The wave function is also used to calculate other properties of a quantum system, such as its energy and angular momentum.

It's important to note that the wave function does not represent the physical state of the system itself, but rather it provides a mathematical way to describe and predict the outcomes of measurements on the system.
